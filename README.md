This game is a variation of the beloved arcade game Pacman! But this time, you must embark on a journey to find the long lost city of Chesselantis which is a city made of cheese. But you must go past the Guardians who protect Cheeselantis and you must deactivate the traps. When deactivating the traps, you will come across a question and you must be able to answer it properly. If you do, you will successfully deactivate the trap and you can continue to deactivate the others. But if you do not answer the question correctly, the trap
will go off and you will die. When you beat the game, you will type in your name so you become the legend of who defeated the monsters and the first to reach Cheeselantis. Keep in mind the monsters can attack you! You can only die if they come in contact with you, not if you come in contact with them. You need to answer 5 questions in a row to beat this game.
